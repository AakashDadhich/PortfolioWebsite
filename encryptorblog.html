        Encryption Simulator

      <h6 class="right purple-text text-accent-1">Why did I choose this project?</h6><br>
      <p>
        This was created for my final year Computing A-Level project. I pretty much had full creative control over the project so, with my
        interest in cybersecurity, I decided to learn about cryptography and create a simulator to emulate different types of encryption
        methods and ciphers.
        <br><br>
        Since learning to program, I've always been interested in cybersecurity but I've never really known how to start learning about it.
        This A-level project gave me the freedom to finally start to educate myself on a specific topic related to security, and encryption
        seemed like a fun place to start. Admittedly, it wasn't the most visually stunning project I've made, but I was using Visual Basic after all.

      <h6 class="right purple-text text-accent-1">Functionality</h6><br>
      <p>
        The simulator comprises of a simulator of 3 different types of ciphers (polyalphabetic, Caesar and RSA) and an instructions page explaining
        how to use each cipher. The gallery above shows what each page looks like. Each simulator page lets you enter some plaintext and a key to be encrypted.
        They also have a 'decrypt a message' button, which will switch the ciphertext and plaintext boxes around and allow for some decryption key input.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6 class="right purple-text text-accent-1">What did I learn from this project?</h6><br>
      <p>
        While the implementation of the polyalphabetic and Caesar ciphers were quite straightforward as their ciphertext is just reversed using the same key,
         RSA wasn't so trivial. The RSA encryption method is asymmetrical, meaning the encryption key and decryption key are different. Replicating this in code
         proved challenging because RSA is meant to be difficult to crack, so the decryption method deals with huge numbers. It actually ended up causing a
         large bug where I discovered the modulus function in VB actually calculates normal division and truncates the result instead of standard integer division.
         <br><br>
         Learning about this concept that's commonly used in 2 factor authentication (like in online banking transactions) was really interesting, and definitely
         perked my interest in learning more about cybersecurity. I have since started reading <i>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</i>, as well as following
         a variety of security related blogs and podcasts.
