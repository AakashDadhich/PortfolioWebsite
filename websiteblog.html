        Building this website
      </h1>
      <br>
      <h6 class="right purple-text text-accent-1">Why did I build this site?</h6><br>
      <p>
        Since I wanted to get myself a portfolio website, and I also wanted to start a new project to learn a new technical skill,
        I decided to teach myself to create websites! I wanted to add my personal touch instead of just what a website
        builder would allow me to do, so I decided to use the Materialize CSS framework.
        <br><br>
        The idea of this portfolio site is for me to have a place to showcase all of my significant projects, and I wanted to start
        a developer blog to log either the process of a certain project, or just to write about something new and cool that I've learned.
        I already have a photography blog where I write about some of my photography expeditions (admittedly they're all very car oriented
        right now, but this is soon to change as I branch out and experiment with other styles), and I wanted to start a similar practice
        with my programming hobby.
        <br><br>
        Check out the project on GitHub below
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/AakashDadhich/PortfolioWebsite" target="_blank" class="blue-grey darken-3 waves-effect waves-light btn purple-text text-accent-1">GitHub Project</a>
      </p>
      <h6 class="right purple-text text-accent-1">What did I learn from this project?</h6><br>
      <p>
        I used this project as a way to learn HTML; I've dabbled with it in the past, but never really made a substanstial project from it.
        Using Materialize made the process fun to experiment with too, as adding certain parameters within the 'class' section of a tag can
        drastically change how a component of your page looks. I was trying to create a side-navigation bar of a specific length different to the
        Materialize default, but could not figure it out, so I left the standard navbar. I came up with the idea to have the navigation links
        in the top left, and my social media links in the top right; it's pretty sleek now if I may say so myself, so I prefer it this way.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6 class="right purple-text text-accent-1">Next steps...</h6><br>
      <p>
        Now that I've had a small attempt creating my first site from scratch in a relatively short amount of time,
        I'm going to redesign from the bottom up my photography website, which I'd previously built using a website builder. Materialise has various
        JavaScript components perfect for a photography gallery, such as carousels and parallax effects that I really can't wait to mess around with.
